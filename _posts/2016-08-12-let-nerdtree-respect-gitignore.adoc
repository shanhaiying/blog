= Let NERDTree respect .gitignore
:experimental:

I am a fan of the https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree[NERDTree] vim plugin.
It adds a nice, toggleable filetree-sidebar to vim. This way, I can always
look at the filetree structure of my projects without getting lost in the
void... That was a feature that I really loved, once I was using https://atom.io/[atom].
Also, the Git integration in the Atom sidebar was quite amazing. Today I'm gonna show
you, internet, how to build a similar sidebar in vim. It is quite easy! :)

First, install the following plugins, using your favorite plugin manager; I use
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug]:

[source, vim script]
.~/.config/nvim/init.vim
----
" ...
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
Plug 'Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin'
Plug 'octref/RootIgnore'
" ...
----

Don't forget to fire up sth. like this, in order to actually download that crap:

----
:source %
:PlugInstall
----

We are almost done, we just need to polish it a little bit more. Add this
to `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`:

[source, vim script]
.~/.config/nvim/init.vim
----
" http://stackoverflow.com/a/21687112
let loaded_netrwPlugin=1           # <1>
let NERDTreeRespectWildIgnore=1    # <2>

noremap <C-n> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>  # <3>
# <4>
autocmd bufenter * if (winnr("$") == 1 && exists("b:NERDTree") && b:NERDTree.isTabTree()) | q | endif
----

<1> Disable the builtin, bloated `netrw` plugin. We don't need two filebrowsers.
<2> Let NERDTree respect the vim `wildignore` setting; find out more it using `:h wildignore`.
<3> Create a mapping to toggle the filebrowser; I use kbd:[ctrl] + kbd:[n].
<4> It's the last line; it is too long to create that black bubble in the same line. This
    autocommand is copied from Github. It does: "close vim if the only window left open is a NERDTree".

We have finished. The `RootIgnore` plugin searches `.gitignore` files in the current working
directory (and some upper directories). When it has found one, it converts the `.gitignore`
files into a vim `wildignore` pattern. NERDTree is able to use that using the mentioned
`NERDTreeRespectWildIgnore` option. The `nerdtree-git-plugin` adds status icons to the
filetree according to the current Git status.
