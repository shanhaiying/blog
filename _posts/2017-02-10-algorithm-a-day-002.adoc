= An Algorithm a Day -- 002 -- Prime Factorization
:page-layout: math
:stem: latexmath

This post might become rather short, but I just want to publish this right now.
I have done some experiments in the public transport with prime factorization.
First, what is prime factorization? Wikipedia says:

[quote, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization]
In number theory, integer factorization is the decomposition of a composite
number into a product of smaller integers. If these integers are further
restricted to prime numbers, the process is called prime factorization.

In maths it would look somehow like this:

[stem]
++++
n=p_{1}^{{\;\;e_{1}}}\cdot p_{2}^{{\;\;e_{2}}}\dotsm p_{M}^{{\ \ e_{M}}}=\prod _{{k=1}}^{{M}}p_{k}^{{\;\;e_{k}}}
++++

There are a lot of methods to accomplish the given task of compositing a number
into a product of primes. I just want to present the IMO most naive and straight
forward one. Actually it was the first algorithm that came in my mind while
sitting in the public transport next to strange people...

import math

def fac(n):
    res = []
    while n > 1:
        until = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
        for i in range(2, until):
            if n % i == 0:
                res.append(i)
                n /= i
                break
        else:
            res.append(int(n))
            return res
    return res

This should be straight forward to understand, as it is some kind of brute force
method. There is basically a loop which counts from stem:[2] to stem:[\sqrt{n}].
The reason for is: if I divide a number stem:[x] into its factors, the greatest
possible factor is stem:[\sqrt{x}]. It is somehow the "half" in the domain of
multiplication. I am too lazy to search a formal correct proof. If somebody has
one that I can include in this blogpost please let me know.

Yeah, the rest is trivial. The algorithm checks if the current counter `i` divides
stem:[n]. When that's possible, we have found a prime factor. If the inner loop
runs until its end, then stem:[n] must be a prime itself.

Bonus points: For the next prime number we divide stem:[n] by `i` and start again!

Bonus points 2: Why are the found numbers primes? Because we count from stem:[0] to
stem:[\sqrt{n}] and not the other way round. The first numbers we find are the primes.
