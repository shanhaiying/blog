= Cat with Syntax Highlighting
:page-liquid:

I am always annoyed about missing syntax highlighting when using the standard
tool `cat`. Long story short, I created my own cat in Python with the pygments
library, which enables highlighting on the terminal. I called the project
`c.py`. The reason is easy: It should be `[c]at`, and it is written in Python,
thus `c.py`.

The project is hosted on Github: https://github.com/rumpelsepp/c.py; I have
written some manpages for `c.py` which are available at my docs subdomain:
https://docs.sevenbyte.org/c.py/

== Let's go!

So, how do you use my super awesome `cat`? I assume that you are able to
install it somehow (on Arch Linux there is a package in the AUR). First things
first.  I wanted to add some automatic paging support as well AND I also wanted
to provide all the features of `cat`. Since I am a lazy person, I did not
reimplement `cat`, I instead wrote an additional shell wrapper `c` (which is
included in the Github project).

So, if you want to view a source file, then you just type:

----
$ c file
----

`c` starts the Python programm `c.py` which uses pygments to detect the
programming language with some magic FOO.  Then the highlighted content is
piped into `less`:

== Additional Features

The shellscript `c` wraps `cat` in a way that all options from `cat` are
available in `c`:

----
$ c -h
Usage: c [-AbeEnstTuv] [-N] [-Vh] [file [file ...]] [--] [c.py options]

cat(1) options:
  -A,     equivalent to -vET
  -b,     number nonempty output lines, overrides -n
  -e      equivalent to -vE
  -E,     display $ at end of each line
  -n,     number all output lines
  -s,     uppress repeated empty output lines
  -t      equivalent to -vT
  -T,     display TAB characters as ^I
  -v,     use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB

less(1) options:
  -N      show linenumbers

c(1) options:
  -p      do not use a pager
  -V      show version string
  -h      display this page and exit

c.py options can be viewed with "c -- -h"
----

If you, for instance want to add line numbers, just use the
`cat` option `-n`:

----
$ c -n file
----


You can also pass several files to `c`, you can read from a pipe, ...  You can
just do everything what `cat` can do PLUS syntax highlighting.

== Configuration

`c.py` accepts a few configuration options which are passed via environment variables.
Those are documented in the manpage: https://docs.sevenbyte.org/c.py/c.py.1.html

== Use c.py in ranger

If you are a nerd like me, then you might know the vim like filemanger `ranger`:
https://github.com/hut/ranger. You can use `c.py` in ranger to benefit from
the much better syntax highlighting capabilities of pygments. You have to modify
the `scope.sh` script like this:

Anyway, I saw that they have included pygments on master now... But I like to use
my own awesome script B-).
